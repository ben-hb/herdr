Description: herdr uses recursive simulations to asymptotically identify the optimal behavior of a bayesian agent who 1.) receives a private signal correlating with the true state of the world 2.) observes the behavior of agents before them and 3.) takes an action correlating with the agent's belief in the state of the world.
